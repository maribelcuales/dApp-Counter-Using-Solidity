# dApp-Counter-Using-Solidity

## About the Project

This is a basic counter dApp which will have an increment and decrement function. It is built using Solidity and web3.js. 

## dApp 

dApp stands for decentralized application. It is a software application that runs on blockchain which is a distributed or decentralized network.   

## Technologies 

Solidity is a high-level and contract-oriented language used for writing Smart Contracts. It is used for designing and implementing Smart Contracts within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and other blockchain platforms. 

Web3.js is a collection of libraries that allow us to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket. It allows to do certain actions such as retrieving user accounts, sending transactions, interactacting with smart contracts, etc.

## Step by Step: 

1. npm install Ganache, Web3.js, and Solcjs
```gitbash  
npm install ganache-cli 
npm install web3 
npm install -g solc  
```

2. Write first Smart Contract in `Counter.sol`.
